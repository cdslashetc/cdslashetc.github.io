#Inspiration

My family is stuck in a hotel due to a fire in our house. So, I am looking for creative recipes that I can make with only a microwave. We eat a lot of international cuisine lately focusing on Korean and Japanese, but we also enjoy Caribbean, Indian, Chinese, Italian, German, French and many others.
